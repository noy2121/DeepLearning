    "### 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "**Classes**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we use the Marvel Heroes image dataset from Kaggle.\n",
    "Each image belongs to one of 8 classes, where each class corresponds to a specific Marvel character:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Black Widow**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Captain America**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Doctor Strange**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hulk**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iron Man**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loki**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spider-Man**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Thanos**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is already organized into folders, one folder per character, with roughly a few hundred images per class. This makes it a natural 8-way image classification problem:\n",
    "Given an image, predict which hero appears in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use-case and Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Superhero images appear everywhere: fan sites, news articles, social media posts, and digital asset libraries.\n",
    "Manually tagging every image with the correct character is time-consuming and error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model that can automatically classify an image as Black Widow, Hulk, Iron Man, etc., could be used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Auto-tag images in a content management system\n",
    "(e.g., “show me all images of Spider-Man”).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improve search and recommendations in a fan app or media platform\n",
    "(e.g., “show me similar images of Loki”).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide a proof-of-concept for using deep learning in entertainment and media applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a small but realistic example of how an image classifier can help organize and search large collections of visual content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Challenges**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the dataset is relatively clean, we expect several challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visual similarity between classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Some heroes share similar colors and costume patterns\n",
    "(e.g., the red/blue themes of Spider-Man and Captain America, or the dark suits of Black Widow and Iron Man), which can confuse the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variation in pose, lighting, and background\n",
    "\n",
    "Characters appear in different:\n",
    "\n",
    "- poses\n",
    "\n",
    "- zoom levels\n",
    "\n",
    "- lighting conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "- environments (city, space, explosions, studio backgrounds)\n",
    "\n",
    "These variations may distract the model or make certain features harder to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Artwork vs. renders vs. movie stills\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset may contain a mixture of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- movie stills\n",
    "\n",
    "- posters\n",
    "\n",
    "- CGI renders\n",
    "\n",
    "- fan art styles\n",
    "\n",
    "The model must learn to focus on character identity, not artistic style.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Potential label noise\n",
    "\n",
    "Some images may:\n",
    "\n",
    "- contain multiple characters, or\n",
    "\n",
    "- be misfiled under the wrong folder\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduces noise into the labels and may reduce accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Class imbalance and overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Some characters may have more images or higher-quality images than others.\n",
    "With only a few thousand total images, we must be careful to avoid overfitting, especially when using a large pretrained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the project will be to investigate these issues using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- confusion matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "- top-loss examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- misclassification analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "and discuss how these factors affect the final results."
